First off, **Welcome to Ennovar!** We are here to teach you as much as we can and get you ready for the industry but first there are a couple things for you to get started working.

1. Make sure you have access to your WSU email, we will use it often.
2. Access [timekeeping](https://timeclock.atai.lan/ennovartime/logon.aspx)
3. Ask a team lead to add you to the ennovar slack team
4. Setup a [GitHub](http://github.com) account if you dont already have one, we will use this for hosting our source control repositories
5. Ask a team lead to add you to the ennovar github organization so you can have access to the teams code
6. Setup [Atom](http://atom.io), this will be used as your text editor for your code. We highly suggest using Atom over other text editors
