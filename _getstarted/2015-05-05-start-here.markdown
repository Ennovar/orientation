First off, **Welcome to Ennovar!** We are here to teach you as much as we can and get you ready for the industry but first there are a couple things for you to get started working.

1. Make sure you have access to your WSU email, we will use it often.
2. Ask a team lead to add you to the ennovar slack team
3. Setup a [GitHub](http://github.com) account if you dont already have one, we will use this for hosting our source control repositories
4. Ask a team lead to add you to the ennovar github organization so you can have access to the teams code
5. Setup [Atom](http://atom.io), this will be used as your text editor for your code. We highly suggest using Atom over other text editors
Next you will need to get brushed up on your web development knowledge
